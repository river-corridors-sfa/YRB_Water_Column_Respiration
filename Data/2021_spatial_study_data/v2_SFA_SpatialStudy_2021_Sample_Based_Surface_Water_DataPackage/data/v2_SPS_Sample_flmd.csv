For each sampling event (e.g. SPS_0005), the  values of each of the three biological replicates for a given measurement (e.g. SPS_0005_OCN-1; SPS_0005_OCN-2; SPS_0005_OCN-3) are averaged. Any replicate values that were an outlier (using distance-based outlier detection) or above/below the limit of detection are not included in the mean. The ""Mean_Missing_Reps"" column indicates if a mean does not include all three replicates using a TRUE/FALSE flag where TRUE indicates one or more replicates are missing from the mean. Some sample types were not collected with replicates (i.e. TSS).",ESS-DIVE Reporting Format for Comma-separated Values (CSV) File Structure (Velliquette et al. 2021); ESS-DIVE Reporting Format for Soil; Sediment; and Water Chemistry (Boye et al. 2022), 2021-08-30, 2021-09-15,N/A; -9999,/v2_SFA_SpatialStudy_2021_SampleData
